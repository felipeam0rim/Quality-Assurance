Application 2 - "Termostato"
- As the thermostat will start off it will only turn on if the temperature reaches 4 ºC, and it will turn off if it reaches or exceeds 23 ºC, the software will only control the status of the switch (ON/OFF).

Application 3 - "Calculadora de Taxa de Juros"
- Observe the scenarios when it will not be possible to complete the deposit. For the age issue, a notification of the impossibility to deposit must appear and for the minimum or maximum amount of the deposit issue, a notification must appear informing the minimum or maximum amount of deposits.
